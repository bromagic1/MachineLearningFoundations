## The Perceptron


The perceptron was invented in 1943 by McCulloch and Pitts. The first implementation was a machine built in 1958 at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory by Frank Rosenblatt, funded by the United States Office of Naval Research. (From wikipedia)


## Consider the perceptron as illustrated in the figure above.

I know:

If the activation function is linear, i.e. the first three cases, then the perceptron is equivalent to a linear classifier.
However, I just wonder:

Is the perceptron equivalent to a non-linear classifier if its activation function is sigmoid?

In other words:

Can the perceptron represent any complex function, if using sigmoid as its activation function?
